# Building-an-EV-database
Build a PaaS application which will be a database for Electric Vehicles. It is required to deal with users who login and logout and alter the functionality for each. In the application users should be able to add and update cars that are in the database. They should also be able to perform comparisons of multiple cars in the database.
